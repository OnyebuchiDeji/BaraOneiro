files_core

File Manager.

File Manager is in charge of reading data from files and returning them in a string format.
Or getting data as string or byte and writing it to file, without modifying it.

Model Reader

Model Reader is in charge of reading the model data from a 3D model file and providing the
data in a useable structure.
After doing this, in other files like the VBO_MANAGER, a VBO object will modify this data
so one can add any additional attribute like Texture IDs and such, before sending to the GPU

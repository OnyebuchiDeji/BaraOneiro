Now, for Shadows, they don't use Fragment Shaders since shadows are just black.
So Fragment Shader attached does nothing --- though they can do something like adding
soft edges.
Shadows are made from the Vertex Shader purely.

This is because Shadows are basically the shape and position of the object itself but
that have been transformed by the Light's direction.
